                        <p>
                          EMgine is a game development tool for designers to give their NPCs &#34;emotions&#34;. 
                          It does this by providing a library for &#34;generating 
                          emotions&#34; given the current state of the game entity &#34;expriencing
                          &#34; emotion and the game world. The end goal is to give designers
                          another option for making believable and emotionally engaging game characters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Game design is both a creative and technical endeavour, so I am using a user-centric 
                          design approach to ensure that both game designers and players are always at the forefront
                          of EMgine&#39;s design. This lead to the library design, which affords game designers the choice
                          of when, how, and what parts of it they use in their games. Game designer needs also drove 
                          the decision to use C# because it is one of the programming languages supported 
                          in <a className='is-link'

                          It was 2022, so I decided that a personal website was an important
                          part of making myself known in academia and industry (especially because
                          I&#39;m trained to do software engineering...). And here we are!

                        <p>
                          Web development was new to me, so it was also an opportunity to learn
                          new things. This was why I chose to use
                          the <a className='is-link'

                          Framework</a> instead of something like <a className='is-link'

                          and my work, while also creating a visually appealing and responsive
                          website. I also aimed to make this webpage accessible by

                          the best of my understanding. I&#39;m sure there are many accessibility improvements to make,

                          I admire many of Ubisoft&#39;s games, so naturally I jumped at the chance to
                          participate in
                          their <a className="is-link"

                          on the theme &#34;my morning routine&#34;, I focused on a challenge that I face almost 
                          daily: escaping my apartment without one of my adorable cats tearing a hole in my stockings.

                          I settled on a horror-style stealth game comparable
                          to <a className="is-link"

                          I decided to play with the idea of feline spirits that are either out to get you, or
                          will (maybe) help you. I submitted a successful one-page
                          pitch describing a the concept and plans for prototyping and testing it. Next,
                          I created a Design Solution Presentation, outlining
                          the intended player experience and success criteria, my inspirations for the design, the game feature
                          itself, and how I would build a prototype in five weeks. Unfortunately, I was not invited to continue
                          past this stage. Still, I am very pleased with the ideas I created for this and I am grateful for the
                          opportunity to work on my game design skills.

                          Before my work on EMgine, my investigation into believable game characters &#34;with 
                          emotions&#34; got me to 
                          try <a className='is-link'
                                 href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding'
                                 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modding</a>. This allowed me to work 
                          with a pre-existing game with well-defined characters so that I only needed to worry about 
                          how emotion &#34;worked&#34; rather than how I could test them in a game. The 
                          modding community for <i>Skyrim</i> is very large and active, so it is a good place for 
                          experiementing with different ideas to see how they affect the game&#39;s player experience.

                          This was a fun and interesting look into one of Bethesda&#39;s development tools and their 
                          implementation of characters. I designed my mod so that characters all used the same 
                          &#34;processing&#34; modules; their differences are contained in character-specific 
                          &#34;configuration data&#34; based on a set of tags I created. Each character is 
                          assigned &#34;values&#34; with data necessary for emotion generation. Picking these 
                          values was entertaining because I got to imagine how each character feels about different 
                          aspects of their world based on theirâ€”often sparseâ€”narrative descriptions.

                          it was still enough for my play testers to notice and be intrigued by the characters&#39; new 
                          reactions to them.
